METHOD 1	Pearson's Chi Square Test								
									
	Define confidence interval as variable "ci"								
									
	Convert variable "x" as factor								
									
	Compute length of rows as variable "nr"								
	 	nr =row length of "x"							
		"nr" must be >= 2  							
		otherwise "error"							
									
	Compute length of column and save it as variable "nc"								
		nc = column length of "x"							
		"nc" must be >= 2 							
		otherwise "error"							
									
	Compute sum of row as variable "sr"								
		sr = sum of rows values of "x"							
									
	Compute sum of column as variable "sc"								
		sc = sum of columns values  of "x"							
									
	Obtain grand total as variable "gt"								
		gt = sum of "x"							
									
	Compute expected values as variable "expc"								
		expc = (sr * sc) / gt							
									
	Compute Chi Sq Statistics as variable "Statistic"								
		Statistic = sum ( ( x - expc ) ^2) / expc							
									
	Compute Degrees of Freedom as variable "df"								
		df = (nr - 1) * (nc - 1)							
									
	Compute ChiSq. critical value as variable "Chisq. Critival Val"								
		Chisq. Critical Val = table value of chi square with df and ci							
									
	Compute p-value as variable "p-value"								
		p-value = pvalue from the table with corresponding df							
									
4	Inference 								
	If Chi square value is > Chisq. Critical Val then we reject the Null Hypothesis								
		and conclude that there is association between the variables							
									
		otherwise accept the Null Hypothesis

METHOD 2	Pearson's Chi Square Test with Probabilities								
									
									
									
2.1	If length of x is not equal to p								
	Stop and promt Error:  " "x" and probability values should be of equal lengths"								
									
2.2	If p < 0								
	Stop and promt Error: "Probabilities value cannot be negative"								
									
2.3	If sum of p is not equal to 1								
	Stop and promt Error: "Sum of probabilities value should be equal to 1"								
									
	If sum of p > 1								
	Stop and promt Error: "Sum of probabilities should not exceed 1"								
									
	If  2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 are satisfied go to step 2.4								
									
2.4	Compute 								
	n = sum of x								
									
	Compute Expected Value								
  	E = n * p	
		
	If any values of  E < 5	
	Promt Warning Message: "Chi Square Approximation may be incorrect"	
	and continue to 2.5	
		
2.5	Compute Chi Sq Statistics as variable "Statistic"	
		Statistic = sum ( ( x - E ) ^2) / E
		
	Compute Degrees of Freedom as variable "df"	
		df = length of (x) - 1
		
	Compute ChiSq. critical value as variable "Chisq. Critival Val"	
		Chisq. Critical Val = table value of chi square with df and ci
		
	Compute p-value as variable "p-value"	
		p-value = pvalue from the table with corresponding df
		
	Inference 	
	If Chi square value is > Chisq. Critical Val then we reject the Null Hypothesis	
		otherwise accept the Null Hypothesis
